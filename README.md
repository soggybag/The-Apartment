# The Apartment

## Setting

A film about people living where no one should with people no one can live with.

## Synopsis

A rock opera about the horrible places where no one should live, and the terrible people that very unfortunately, still live there.

## Soundtrack

Although the plot is generally depressing, the music should be balanced between dark (think Tim Burton) and uplifting (think John Williams) to keep viewers at ease. Set to a new wave rock sound track by Polysics and the Polyphonic Spree.

## Cast

- Wealthy Heiress: Jade Stone
- Hunky Handyman: Eli'el Gordon
- Cynical Landlord: Adam Braus
- Eccentric Neighbor: Alan Davis
- Snarky Neighbor Kid: Jordan King
- Crusty Wise Old Man: Mitchell Hudson
- The cockroach: Jeremy Rossman
- The potted plant: Mike Kane
- Spirit in the fireplace: Ashu Desai

## Notes

This sounds like a pretty depressing film with little uplift to redeem the plot. Mitchell, are you feeling okay? Do you need a place to stay?
